      <description>Simple Mobile Tools are a set of open-source &amp;ldquo;shareware&amp;rdquo; apps. Examples of applications included in the suite include &amp;ldquo;Simple Gallery&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Simple Calendar&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Simple Contacts&amp;rdquo;.
While the applications are open-source, the developer made money through proprietary app stores versions. From the Play Store, the Gallery is only free for 14 days, before you are required to buy a license. F-Droid and GitHub were options for acquiring fully-free binaries, but not often used by regular users.</description>
