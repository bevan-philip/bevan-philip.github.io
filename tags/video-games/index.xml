      <description>The mundanity of seeing online CS during the pandemic has electrified a transition that was already happening - the end of tier 1 online events. The leagues were the last victims, with FLASHPOINT&amp;rsquo;s last event setting the framework for future online events.
But the pandemic also unearthed a deeper scar tissue within the scene - the economics stopped making sense a long time ago. The industry has tried to paper over this with agreements such as the Louvre Agreement - tournament organisers would sell a fixed number of slots, which would guarantee you access to tier 1 offline events.</description>

      <description>North American Counter-Strike is dead, or in the middle of dying.
Team Liquid, the prototypical NA team, now fields a primarily European roster, while Cloud9&amp;rsquo;s roster is Russian. The remaining stalwarts in Complexity and EG are not competitive internationally.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t unique to North America. This death of the national team is framed as a problem endemic to North America. But one only needs to look in Europe to see that the concept as a whole, is withering away.</description>

      <description>CS:GO Majors are supposed to be a raucous celebration of the game. The place where the best teams duke it out, in a desperate bid to establish themselves as the apex predator. There is no such as a free round within this theatre.
Yet Boston 2018 was the last CS:GO major final to ever reach 3 maps.
7 consecutive major finals, where the loser could not muster one map.
What is going on?</description>

      <description>Counter-Strike events seem to have less energy than ever. There are no concrete statistics to back this up, but the symphonies of Counter-Strike sound more like a small chorale. The crowds have gone from ecstasy, to gentle applause.
If this is the case, pointing to a single cause is difficult. To list a few changes:
The makeup of teams has changed, with fan favourites such as NiP, SK and fnatic having all disappeared from the high levels of the scene.</description>
